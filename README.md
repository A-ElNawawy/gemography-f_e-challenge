## Libraries:
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) => for styling using css-in-js.

- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

##

Functions used in App.js are located in includes dir, and each of them has its documentation

We prefer to use css-in-js using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library
it is easy to use, just like Sass.
